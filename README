What is CHM View Kit ?
===============================================

CHM View kit is a simple and fast CHM viewer

it got a server and web application and a GUI

How different from other applications ?
===============================================

chmsee wast disk space by extracting CHM file content
into ~/.chmsee/bookshelf and view it while chmviewkit
works on the fly

gnochm uses xul (from mozilla), while we use webkit, a very lightweight library

and compared to both we got a very rich UI
